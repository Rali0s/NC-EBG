# Neuro Cognition Explorative Brain Generation**

A Python-based project that generates audio/visual brainwave entrainment patterns for cognitive enhancement, focus, and relaxation.  
This tool was designed as a **creative, educational, and experimental framework** for exploring neuro-modulation concepts such as binaural beats, frequency following response, and layered entrainment routines.

## Goal:
The primary purpose of this project is to drop the brains cognitive processing down from 'Waking-Consciousness' into 'Deep-Theta' while looping processing waves in sequental from back from 'Alpha -> Down to Theta' again, twice. While this is occuring, we are attempting to overload the brains processing without causing discomform to alter its state.

More to come!

Use responsibly and only in safe, controlled environments.

By using this software, you acknowledge that it is provided "as is" without warranty of any kind.

## üéØ Purpose

The **Neuro-Brainwave Generator** aims to provide:

- A programmable way to generate **brainwave audio signals** (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Theta, Delta).  
- Visual synchronization patterns for **research and wellness experimentation**.  
- A modular design to allow new **frequency sequences and mapping strategies** to be added easily.  

This project is not intended as medical software; it is a tool for creative and educational exploration.

---
## üõ†Ô∏è How It Was Made

- **Language:** Python 3
- **GPT-5 Engine**
- **Audio Engine:** Uses sine wave and harmonic layering to build entrainment tracks.  
- **Visualization:** Optional plotting modules and waveform visualizers.  
- **Structure:** Built in modular steps:
  1. Define frequency tables and waveforms.
  2. Build sequencing logic for transitions between states.
  3. Add visual layer mapping (outer/inner rings, geometric overlays).
  4. Expand with memory/attention gamification ideas.

# Metatron Neuro Wheel (Fluid)

`metatron_neuro_wheel_fluid.py` renders a fluid, living ‚Äúneuro-wheel‚Äù visualization:
Metatron lines reworked for **FLUID growth & glow**, **ray-seeded activation**, and
nested sub-cycles. Built for creative, educational exploration of brainwave pacing
and visual entrainment‚Äînot medical use.

> Core stack: **Python 3 + pygame**.  
> Visual style: curved links (bezier-like), soft glows, banded rings, ray seeds.

---
## ‚ú® What it does

- **Fluid Metatron overlay**: curved, growing line segments that ‚Äúbreathe‚Äù and glow.
- **Ray-seeded activation**: stochastic rays propagate energy through nodes/edges.
- **Banded rings**: outer/mid/inner rings can sync to Alpha/Beta/Theta/Gamma/Delta.
- **Nested sub-cycles**: per-ring micro-loops (e.g., Gamma‚ÜíAlpha‚ÜíBeta‚ÜíTheta‚Ä¶).
- **Curved links**: bezier-like interpolation for organic motion (no rigid spokes).
- **Reward bars (prototype)**: optional HUD for Alertness/Patience/Credibility/etc.
